###See it [live](https://harunfr.github.io/top-recipes/).

This project is about recipes page that contains 3 recipe.

Only basic html knowledge used in this project. Here is what I learned by doing this project:
* Without using advanced routes, direct user to other pages.
* Adding width attribute to img may help quick development to see how image is seen on screen without using css.

[This site](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes#viewing-your-project-on-the-web) may help developers to make same project.
