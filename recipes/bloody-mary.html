      Story of this drink: My father-in-law first introduced me to this homemade bloody mary mix. It is very similar to what you'd buy in a store. Made as is, it is very spicy. You can customize it to your taste by cutting back on the pepper and hot sauce; I like about half the pepper and hot sauce. Enjoy this wonderful mix! It is so easy and much cheaper than buying pre-made mix.
